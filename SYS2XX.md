:bulb: A reflection is a note to your future self; it covers those subjects and concepts that gave you difficulty and those you have mastery over. Be honest in these reflections but also congratulate yourself on things that went well. Your reflection should be useful and not something like: ```Everything went fine this week```.  It should also link to any relevant documentation articles you have authored as well.
# Week 1
> This week we configured our base environment, new topics included OpnSense firewall and Active Directory running on Server Core. Some of the lessons learned this week were to make sure you've renamed your AD server's hostname before installing Active Directory and to make sure that RFC1918 addresses are allowed through the firewall.

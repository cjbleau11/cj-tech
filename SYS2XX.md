# Week 1
> This week we configured our base environment, new topics included OpnSense firewall and Active Directory running on Server Core. Some of the lessons learned this week were to make sure you've renamed your AD server's hostname before installing Active Directory and to make sure that RFC1918 addresses are allowed through the firewall.
